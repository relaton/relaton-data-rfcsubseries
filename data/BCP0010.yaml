        IETF leadership committees. RFC 8713 provides criteria for NomCom membership
        that attempt to ensure NomCom volunteers are members of the loosely defined
        IETF community, by requiring in-person attendance in three of the past five
        in-person meetings. In 2020 and 2021, the IETF had six consecutive fully online
        plenary meetings that drove rapid advancement in remote meeting technologies
        and procedures, including an experiment that included remote attendance for
        NomCom eligibility. This document updates RFC 8713 by defining a new set of
        eligibility criteria from first principles, with consideration to the increased
        salience of remote attendance. This document obsoletes RFCs 8788 and 8989.</p>"
