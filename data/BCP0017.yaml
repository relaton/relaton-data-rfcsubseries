    abstract:
    - content: "<p>It has become a common practice to use symbolic names (usually
        CNAMEs) in the Domain Name Service (DNS - [RFC-1034, RFC-1035]) to refer to
        network services such as anonymous FTP [RFC-959] servers, Gopher [RFC- 1436]
        servers, and most notably World-Wide Web HTTP [RFC-1945] servers. This is
        desirable for a number of reasons. It provides a way of moving services from
        one machine to another transparently, and a mechanism by which people or agents
        may programmatically discover that an organization runs, say, a World-Wide
        Web server. Although this approach has been almost universally adopted, there
        is no standards document or similar specification for these commonly used
        names. This document seeks to rectify this situation by gathering together
        the extant 'folklore' on naming conventions, and proposes a mechanism for
        accommodating new protocols. This document specifies an Internet Best Current
        Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions
        for improvements.</p>"
