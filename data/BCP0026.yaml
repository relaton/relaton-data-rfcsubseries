    abstract:
    - content: "<p>Many protocols make use of points of extensibility that use constants
        to identify various protocol parameters. To ensure that the values in these
        fields do not have conflicting uses and to promote interoperability, their
        allocations are often coordinated by a central record keeper. For IETF protocols,
        that role is filled by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).</p><p>To
        make assignments in a given registry prudently, guidance describing the conditions
        under which new values should be assigned, as well as when and how modifications
        to existing values can be made, is needed. This document defines a framework
        for the documentation of these guidelines by specification authors, in order
        to assure that the provided guidance for the IANA Considerations is clear
        and addresses the various issues that are likely in the operation of a registry.</p><p>This
        is the third edition of this document; it obsoletes RFC 5226.</p>"
