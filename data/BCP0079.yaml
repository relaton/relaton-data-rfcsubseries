    abstract:
    - content: "<p>The IETF policies about Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), such
        as patent rights, relative to technologies developed in the IETF are designed
        to ensure that IETF working groups and participants have as much information
        as possible about any IPR constraints on a technical proposal as early as
        possible in the development process. The policies are intended to benefit
        the Internet community and the public at large, while respecting the legitimate
        rights of IPR holders. This document sets out the IETF policies concerning
        IPR related to technology worked on within the IETF. It also describes the
        objectives that the policies are designed to meet. This document updates RFC
        2026 and, with RFC 5378, replaces Section 10 of RFC 2026. This document also
        obsoletes RFCs 3979 and 4879.</p>"
