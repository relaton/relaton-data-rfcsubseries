    abstract:
    - content: <p>All self-governing bodies have ways of managing the scope of participant
        interaction. The IETF uses a consensus-driven process for developing computer-communications
        standards in an open fashion. An important part of this consensus-driven process
        is the pervasive use of mailing lists for discussion. Notably, in a small
        number of cases, a participant has engaged in a "denial-of-service" attack
        to disrupt the consensus-driven process. Regrettably, as these bad faith attacks
        become more common, the IETF needs to establish a practice that reduces or
        eliminates these attacks. This memo recommends such a practice for use by
        the IETF. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the
        Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>
