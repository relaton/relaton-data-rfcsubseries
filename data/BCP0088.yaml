    abstract:
    - content: <p>The charter of the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) Extensions working
        group (pppext) includes the responsibility to "actively advance PPP's most
        useful extensions to full standard, while defending against further enhancements
        of questionable value." In support of that charter, the allocation of PPP
        protocol and other assigned numbers will no longer be "first come first served."
        This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet
        Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>
