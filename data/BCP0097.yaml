        not have a normative reference to another standards track document at a lower

        not have a normative reference to an informational RFC. Exceptions to this
        rule are sometimes needed as the IETF uses informational RFCs to describe
        non-IETF standards or IETF-specific modes of use of such standards. This document

    - content: <p>The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and Request for Comments
        (RFC) Editor have a long-standing rule that a document at a given maturity
        level cannot be published until all of the documents that it references as
        normative are at that maturity level or higher. This rule has sometimes resulted
        in very long publication delays for documents and some claims that it was
        a major obstruction to advancing documents in maturity level. The IETF agreed
        on a way to bypass this rule with RFC 3967. This document describes a simpler
        procedure for downward references to Standards-Track and Best Current Practice
        (BCP) documents, namely "note and move on". The procedure in RFC 3967 still
        applies for downward references to other classes of documents. In both cases,
        annotations should be added to such References. This document specifies an
        Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion
        and suggestions for improvements.</p>
