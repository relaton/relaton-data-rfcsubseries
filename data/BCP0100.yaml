    abstract:
    - content: <p>This memo describes the process for early allocation of code points
        by IANA from registries for which "Specification Required", "RFC Required",
        "IETF Review", or "Standards Action" policies apply. This process can be used
        to alleviate the problem where code point allocation is needed to facilitate
        desired or required implementation and deployment experience prior to publication
        of an RFC, which would normally trigger code point allocation. The procedures
        in this document are intended to apply only to IETF Stream documents.</p>
