    abstract:
    - content: <p>As the Internet has evolved, many types of arrangements have been
        advertised and sold as "Internet connectivity". Because these may differ significantly
        in the capabilities they offer, the range of options, and the lack of any
        standard terminology, the effort to distinguish between these services has
        caused considerable consumer confusion. This document provides a list of terms
        and definitions that may be helpful to providers, consumers, and, potentially,
        regulators in clarifying the type and character of services being offered.
        This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet
        Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>
