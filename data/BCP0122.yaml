    - content: "<p>This memo discusses the strategy for address assignment of the
        existing 32-bit IPv4 address space with a view toward conserving the address
        space and limiting the growth rate of global routing state. This document
        obsoletes the original Classless Inter-domain Routing (CIDR) spec in RFC 1519,
        with changes made both to clarify the concepts it introduced and, after more
        than twelve years, to update the Internet community on the results of deploying
        the technology described. This document specifies an Internet Best Current
        Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions
        for improvements.</p>"
