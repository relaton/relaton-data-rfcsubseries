    abstract:
    - content: "<p>There have been a number of proposals for alternate semantics for
        the Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) field in the IP header RFC 3168.
        This document discusses some of the issues in defining alternate semantics
        for the ECN field, and specifies requirements for a safe coexistence in an
        Internet that could include routers that do not understand the defined alternate
        semantics. This document evolved as a result of discussions with the authors
        of one recent proposal for such alternate semantics. This document specifies
        an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests
        discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
