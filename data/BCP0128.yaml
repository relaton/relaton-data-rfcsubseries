    abstract:
    - content: "<p>This document describes the Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) behavior
        of currently deployed MPLS networks. This document makes best practice recommendations
        for anyone defining an application to run over an MPLS network that wishes
        to avoid the reordering that can result from transmission of different packets
        from the same flow over multiple different equal cost paths. These recommendations
        rely on inspection of the IP version number field in packets. Despite the
        heuristic nature of the recommendations, they provide a relatively safe way
        to operate MPLS networks, even if future allocations of IP version numbers
        were made for some purpose. This document specifies an Internet Best Current
        Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions
        for improvements.</p>"
