    abstract:
    - content: "<p>This document provides guidance to designers of Authentication,
        Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) key management protocols. The guidance
        is also useful to designers of systems and solutions that include AAA key
        management protocols. Given the complexity and difficulty in designing secure,
        long-lasting key management algorithms and protocols by experts in the field,
        it is almost certainly inappropriate for IETF working groups without deep
        expertise in the area to be designing their own key management algorithms
        and protocols based on Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)
        protocols. The guidelines in this document apply to documents requesting publication
        as IETF RFCs. Further, these guidelines will be useful to other standards
        development organizations (SDOs) that specify AAA key management. This document
        specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and
        requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
