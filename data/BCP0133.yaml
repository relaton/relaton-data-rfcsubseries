    abstract:
    - content: "<p>The IETF's standard congestion control schemes have been widely
        shown to be inadequate for various environments (e.g., high-speed networks).
        Recent research has yielded many alternate congestion control schemes that
        significantly differ from the IETF's congestion control principles. Using
        these new congestion control schemes in the global Internet has possible ramifications
        to both the traffic using the new congestion control and to traffic using
        the currently standardized congestion control. Therefore, the IETF must proceed
        with caution when dealing with alternate congestion control proposals. The
        goal of this document is to provide guidance for considering alternate congestion
        control algorithms within the IETF. This document specifies an Internet Best
        Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and
        suggestions for improvements.</p>"
