    abstract:
    - content: "<p>Enterprise users require mobility and secure connectivity when
        they roam and connect to the services offered in the enterprise. Secure connectivity
        is required when the user connects to the enterprise from an untrusted network.
        Mobility is beneficial when the user moves, either inside or outside the enterprise
        network, and acquires a new IP address. This document describes a solution
        using Mobile IPv4 (MIPv4) and mobility extensions to IKEv2 (MOBIKE) to provide
        secure connectivity and mobility. This document specifies an Internet Best
        Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and
        suggestions for improvements.</p>"
