    abstract:
    - content: "<p>There are a number of circumstances in which an escape mechanism
        is needed in conjunction with a protocol to encode characters that cannot
        be represented or transmitted directly. With ASCII coding, the traditional
        escape has been either the decimal or hexadecimal numeric value of the character,
        written in a variety of different ways. The move to Unicode, where characters
        occupy two or more octets and may be coded in several different forms, has
        further complicated the question of escapes. This document discusses some
        options now in use and discusses considerations for selecting one for use
        in new IETF protocols, and protocols that are now being internationalized.
        This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet
        Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
