    abstract:
    - content: <p>The Security Considerations sections of many Internet Drafts say,
        in effect, "just use IPsec". While this is sometimes correct, more often it
        will leave users without real, interoperable security mechanisms. This memo
        offers some guidance on when IPsec Version 2 should and should not be specified.
        This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet
        Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>
