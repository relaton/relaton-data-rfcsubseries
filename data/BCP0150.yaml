    abstract:
    - content: "<p>This document defines a set of requirements for NATs handling the
        Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP). These requirements allow DCCP
        applications, such as streaming applications, to operate consistently, and
        they are very similar to the TCP requirements for NATs, which have already
        been published by the IETF. Ensuring that NATs meet this set of requirements
        will greatly increase the likelihood that applications using DCCP will function
        properly. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the
        Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
