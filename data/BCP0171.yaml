    abstract:
    - content: "<p>It has been common for network administrators to filter IP traffic
        from and BGP prefixes of unallocated IPv4 address space. Now that there are
        no longer any unallocated IPv4 /8s, this practise is more complicated, fragile,
        and expensive. Network administrators are advised to remove filters based
        on the registration status of the address space.</p><p>This document explains
        why any remaining packet and BGP prefix filters for unallocated IPv4 /8s should
        now be removed on border routers and documents those IPv4 unicast prefixes
        that should not be routed across the public Internet. This memo documents
        an Internet Best Current Practice.</p>"
