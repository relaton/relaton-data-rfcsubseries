    abstract:
    - content: "<p>Time zone information serves as a basic protocol element in protocols,
        such as the calendaring suite and DHCP. The Time Zone (TZ) Database specifies
        the indices used in various protocols, as well as their semantic meanings,
        for all localities throughout the world. This database has been meticulously
        maintained and distributed free of charge by a group of volunteers, coordinated
        by a single volunteer who is now planning to retire. This memo specifies procedures
        involved with maintenance of the TZ database and associated code, including
        how to submit proposed updates, how decisions for inclusion of those updates
        are made, and the selection of a designated expert by and for the time zone
        community. The intent of this memo is, to the extent possible, to document
        existing practice and provide a means to ease succession of the database maintainers.
        This memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice.</p>"
