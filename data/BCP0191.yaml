    - content: "<p>IEEE 802.1 has specified Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) Operations,
        Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) facilities. CFM messages are structured
        with an OpCode field and have provision for the inclusion of TLV-structured
        information. IEEE 802.1 has allocated blocks of CFM OpCodes and TLV Types
        to the IETF. This document specifies the IANA considerations for the assignment
        of values from these blocks.</p>"
