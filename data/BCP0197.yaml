    abstract:
    - content: "<p>This memo presents recommendations to the Internet community concerning
        measures to improve and preserve Internet performance. It presents a strong
        recommendation for testing, standardization, and widespread deployment of
        active queue management (AQM) in network devices to improve the performance
        of today's Internet. It also urges a concerted effort of research, measurement,
        and ultimate deployment of AQM mechanisms to protect the Internet from flows
        that are not sufficiently responsive to congestion notification.</p><p>Based
        on 15 years of experience and new research, this document replaces the recommendations
        of RFC 2309.</p>"
