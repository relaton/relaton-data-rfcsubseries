    abstract:
    - content: <p>This document describes the DNS Security Extensions (commonly called
        "DNSSEC") that are specified in RFCs 4033, 4034, and 4035, as well as a handful
        of others. One purpose is to introduce all of the RFCs in one place so that
        the reader can understand the many aspects of DNSSEC. This document does not
        update any of those RFCs. A second purpose is to state that using DNSSEC for
        origin authentication of DNS data is the best current practice. A third purpose
        is to provide a single reference for other documents that want to refer to
        DNSSEC.</p>
