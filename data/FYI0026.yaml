        available for telecommunications planning. This document is intended to bridge
        that gap and provides a recommended technical direction, an introduction to
        the role the Internet now plays in K-12 education and technical guidelines
        for building a campus data communications infrastructure that provides internetworking
        services and connections to the Internet. This memo provides information for
        the Internet community. This memo does not specify an Internet standard of
