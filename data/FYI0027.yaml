    abstract:
    - content: "<p>Although widely used (and most of the times unnoticed), DNS (Domain
        Name System) is too much overlooked, in the sense that people, especially
        administrators, tend to ignore possible anomalies as long as applications
        that need name-to-address mapping continue to work. This document presents
        some tools available for domain administrators to detect and correct those
        anomalies. This memo provides information for the Internet community. This
        memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.</p>"
