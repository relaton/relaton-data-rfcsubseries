    abstract:
    - content: "<p>This Glossary provides definitions, abbreviations, and explanations
        of terminology for information system security. The 334 pages of entries offer
        recommendations to improve the comprehensibility of written material that
        is generated in the Internet Standards Process (RFC 2026). The recommendations
        follow the principles that such writing should (a) use the same term or definition
        whenever the same concept is mentioned; (b) use terms in their plainest, dictionary
        sense; (c) use terms that are already well-established in open publications;
        and (d) avoid terms that either favor a particular vendor or favor a particular
        technology or mechanism over other, competing techniques that already exist
        or could be developed. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
