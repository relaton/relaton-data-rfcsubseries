    abstract:
    - content: "<p>This document revises the specifications in RFC 733, in order to
        serve the needs of the larger and more complex ARPA Internet. Some of RFC
        733's features failed to gain adequate acceptance. In order to simplify the
        standard and the software that follows it, these features have been removed.
        A different addressing scheme is used, to handle the case of internetwork
        mail; and the concept of re-transmission has been introduced. Obsoletes RFC
        733, NIC 41952.</p>"
