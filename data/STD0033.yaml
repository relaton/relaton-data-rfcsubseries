        this that its name comes, Trivial File Transfer Protocol or TFTP. Each nonterminal
        packet is acknowledged separately. This document describes the protocol and
        its types of packets. The document also explains the reasons behind some of
        the design decisions. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
