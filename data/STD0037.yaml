        Addresses (e.g., IP addresses) to Local Network Addresses (e.g., Ethernet
        addresses). This is an issue of general concern in the ARPA Internet Community
        at this time. The method proposed here is presented for your consideration
        and comment. This is not the specification of an Internet Standard.</p>"
