    abstract:
    - content: "<p>This document specifies the Host Access Protocol (HAP). Although
        HAP was originally designed as the network-access level protocol for the DARPA/DCA
        sponsored Wideband Packet Satellite Network, it is intended that it evolve
        into a standard interface SATNET and TACNET (aka MATNET) as well as the Wideband
        Network. HAP is an experimental protocol, and will undergo further revision
        as new capabilities are added and/or different satellite networks are suported.
        Implementations of HAP should be performed in coordination with satellite
        network development and operations personnel.</p>"
