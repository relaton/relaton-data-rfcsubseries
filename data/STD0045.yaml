    abstract:
    - content: "<p>This memo intends to provide a complete discussion of the protocols
        and techniques used to embed DoD standard Internet Protocol datagrams (and
        its associated higher level protocols) on Network Systems Corporation's HYPERchannel
        equipment. This document is directed toward network planners and implementors
        who are already familiar with the TCP/IP protocol suite and the techniques
        used to carry TCP/IP traffic on common networks such as the DDN or the Ethernet.
        No great familiarity with NSC products is assumed; an appendix is devoted
        to a review of NSC technologies and protocols.</p>"
