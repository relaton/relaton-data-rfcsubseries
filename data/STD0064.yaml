    abstract:
    - content: "<p>This memorandum describes RTP, the real-time transport protocol.
        RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications
        transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over
        multicast or unicast network services. RTP does not address resource reservation
        and does not guarantee quality-of- service for real-time services. The data
        transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of
        the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to
        provide minimal control and identification functionality. RTP and RTCP are
        designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers.
        The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers. Most of
        the text in this memorandum is identical to RFC 1889 which it obsoletes. There
        are no changes in the packet formats on the wire, only changes to the rules
        and algorithms governing how the protocol is used. The biggest change is an
        enhancement to the scalable timer algorithm for calculating when to send RTCP
        packets in order to minimize transmission in excess of the intended rate when
        many participants join a session simultaneously. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
