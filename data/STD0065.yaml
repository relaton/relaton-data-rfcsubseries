    abstract:
    - content: <p>This document describes a profile called "RTP/AVP" for the use of
        the real-time transport protocol (RTP), version 2, and the associated control
        protocol, RTCP, within audio and video multiparticipant conferences with minimal
        control. It provides interpretations of generic fields within the RTP specification
        suitable for audio and video conferences. In particular, this document defines
        a set of default mappings from payload type numbers to encodings. This document
        also describes how audio and video data may be carried within RTP. It defines
        a set of standard encodings and their names when used within RTP. The descriptions
        provide pointers to reference implementations and the detailed standards.
        This document is meant as an aid for implementors of audio, video and other
        real-time multimedia applications. This memorandum obsoletes RFC 1890. It
        is mostly backwards-compatible except for functions removed because two interoperable
        implementations were not found. The additions to RFC 1890 codify existing
        practice in the use of payload formats under this profile and include new
        payload formats defined since RFC 1890 was published. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
