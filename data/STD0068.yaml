    abstract:
    - content: "<p>Internet technical specifications often need to define a formal
        syntax. Over the years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), called
        Augmented BNF (ABNF), has been popular among many Internet specifications.
        The current specification documents ABNF. It balances compactness and simplicity
        with reasonable representational power. The differences between standard BNF
        and ABNF involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence,
        and value ranges. This specification also supplies additional rule definitions
        and encoding for a core lexical analyzer of the type common to several Internet
        specifications. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
