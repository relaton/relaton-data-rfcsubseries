    abstract:
    - content: <p>This memo defines a MIME content type that may be used by a Mail
        User Agent (MUA) or electronic mail gateway to report the disposition of a
        message after it has been successfully delivered to a recipient. This content
        type is intended to be machine processable. Additional message header fields
        are also defined to permit Message Disposition Notifications (MDNs) to be
        requested by the sender of a message. The purpose is to extend Internet Mail
        to support functionality often found in other messaging systems, such as X.400
        and the proprietary "LAN-based" systems, and are often referred to as "read
        receipts," "acknowledgements," or "receipt notifications." The intention is
        to do this while respecting privacy concerns, which have often been expressed
        when such functions have been discussed in the past.</p><p>Because many messages
        are sent between the Internet and other messaging systems (such as X.400 or
        the proprietary "LAN-based" systems), the MDN protocol is designed to be useful
        in a multiprotocol messaging environment. To this end, the protocol described
        in this memo provides for the carriage of "foreign" addresses, in addition
        to those normally used in Internet Mail. Additional attributes may also be
        defined to support "tunneling" of foreign notifications through Internet Mail.</p><p>This
        document is an Internet Standard. It obsoletes RFC 3798 and updates RFC 2046
        (message/partial media type handling) and RFC 3461 (Original-Recipient header
        field generation requirement).</p>
